This is important as the WWW is the main form of information and interconnection for most people nowadays.

#### Grace Hopper

> Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and one of the first programmers of the `Harvard Mark I` computer. She also invented one of the first linker programs. Hopper theorised machine-dependent programming languages and created `FLOW-MATIC`, which later inspired `COBOL`, a high level programming language for businesses.

#### Alan Turing

> Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. He is renowned for the development of theoretical computer science, algorithms and computation through his invention – "The Turing Machine", considered to be a model of a general-purpose computer.

#### Margaret Hamilton

> Margaret Hamilton is an American computer scientist and systems engineer. She was the director of the software engineering division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed software for NASA's Apollo program.

#### Dennis Ritchie

> Dennis Ritchie was an American computer scientist renowned for creating the C programming language, which then became the "Mother" of most modern languages with its inspiring syntax. He also developed the Unix Operating System with Ken Thompson, inspiring many modern Unix and Unix-like Operating Systems.

<summary>Definitions</summary>

#### Network

> A computer network is a collection of computers (nodes) that are connected with wires or wirelessly to transmit and receive data.

#### Device

> A device in a computer network is what the network is comprised of, also referred to as 'Nodes'. There are two different types of devices - end devices and intermediary devices. End devices are either the source or destination of a transmission, so a client device like a personal computer, or a server. Intermediary devices assist the flow of data transmission by forwarding them, such as routers.

#### Router

> A router in a computer network is as the name suggests, an intermediary device that is responsible for forwading data packets (routing them) through a network until they reach an end device. Also, a router connects all devices connected to it and forms a local network.

![](<https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffthmb.tqn.com%2F55b_4EdpJWd2nwIx3w6JvKqdq5Q%3D%2F5001x3335%2Ffilters%3Afill(auto%2C1)%2Fwireless-router-57ee8cea5f9b586c353f3e9f.jpg&f=1&nofb=1>)

#### Switch

> A switch in a computer network is an intermediary device which is responsible for forwading transmitted packets from one device to another within a Local Area Network (LAN).

#### Gateway

> A gateway is a network node which is responsible for connecting two networks together that use different protocols. Gateways are located on the edge of a network and manages receiving and transmitted packets to and from that network.

#### Repeater

> Just like a Minecraft Redstone repeater, repeaters in a computer network are devices that are responsible for strengthening a signal over a long distance. These devices operate on Layer 1 of the OSI Model (the physical layer).

#### Server

> A server is an end device which is capable of receiving requests, processing them, and responding thus delivering or 'serving' data packets back to the requester Node, which is referred to as a client Node.

#### File Server

> A file server is a type of server which is responsible for storing, accessing and managing files within a network. I.e. a file server is a Node which provides shared disk access within a network. Standard protocols for accessing file servers are FTP and HTTP/HTTPS.

![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.stack.imgur.com%2FCaRC6.png&f=1&nofb=1)

#### Web Server

> A web server is a type of server which is responsible for serving data to a client over HTTP. Web servers are responsible for delivering webpages to the browser after a request has been routed to them after a DNS lookup and a TCP handshake. Nowadays, web servers can also be used for REST, GraphQL etc APIs which extends their usage to a general client-server communication. Popular web servers include Apache Web Server and NginX. NginX is also a reverse proxy.

#### Database

> A database is a structured and organized collection of large amounts of data usually stored on a computer, controlled by a management system (DBMS). The two most common and popular databases are Relational Databases (RDBMS), e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL and NoSQL Databases, e.g. MongoDB and Redis. Relational databases have schemas, organize data into tables and use SQL to query the database. NoSQL Databases are semistructured or not structured at all, and are often used in complex web applications.

#### Proxy

> A proxy is a middleman which receives requests and redirects them. Proxy servers can be bidirectional gateways which control the received and transmitted requests to and from a network. The power of this redirecting can prevent malicious users from entering a network, and prevent users of a network from accessing malicious content. Proxy servers can also be used as a cache, so they filter and also improve performance.

#### Printer

> A network printer is a type of printer which is a Node of a network and can be accessed through such network.

#### Network Topology

> A network topology is a representation of the arrangement of how Nodes in a computer network are connected.

#### Ring

> A ring topology is a type of network topology where Nodes are connected in a closed path. An application of ring topology is in a school campus; this allows higher speed transmission of data packets between buildings. These are usually used in a WAN or a MAN.

| Advantages                            | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cheap and easy to setup               | An error in one Node will stop the entire network                                                                                                      |
| High speed data transmission          | Security threats; since data packets pass through all Nodes until the destination, it's easy to add a malicious middleman that intercepts data packets |
| No problems with transmitting packets | Adding or removing Nodes to the network can be inefficient and difficult; it's like a Circular Linked List after all                                   |

![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.comparitech.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F11%2FRing-Topology.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

#### Ethernet/Bus

> A bus topology is a type of network topology where Nodes are connected through each other in a linear way between two terminators with Ethernet cables, like a Linked List. Say the structure `A -> B -> C`, if A wanted to transmit data to C, those packets would need to go through B, and since the destination address doesn't match B, B discards it and the packets go to C. Bus topologies are generally used for small, budget networks.

| Advantages                                                                 | Disadvantages                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extremely cheap and easy to setup                                          | Slow worst case time to transmit packets than other topologies                         |
| Adding or removing Nodes to the network is fairly straightforward          | Bus topology networks must be kept small, as more Nodes will decrease performance      |
| A problem in one Node won't affect the entire network unlike Ring topology | The 'backbone cable' of the bus topology must be constantly checked for good condition |

![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.comparitech.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F11%2FBus-Topology.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

#### Star

> A star topology is a type of network topology where Nodes are connected to a central Node, usually a hub or a switch. The central Node of a star can be wired or wireless. Star topologies are used anywhere and are scalable, but most importantly used for networks where communication through a central Node is important, such as a medical center.

| Advantages                                                                                    | Disadvantages                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Easy to setup                                                                                 | If the central device has a problem, the entire network is 'broken'      |
| Easy to add and remove Nodes to the network, especially if the central device is wireless     | Much more expensive to establish than previous alternatives              |
| Scalable and problems in Nodes that aren't the central device won't affect the entire network | Could be insecure as a wireless network, as anybody can join the network |

#### Hybrid

> A hybrid topology is a type of network topology which is usually large scale and is a composition of two or more basic network topologies. E.g. a hybrid network could be a Star connected to a Ring through a Bus. One use case of these topologies is to connect multiple offices of different network topologies together. The below image depicts a Ring -> Bus -> Star Hybrid network.

| Advantages                                                                                                                                                                      | Disadvantages                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| This structure is scalable                                                                                                                                                      | Extremely expensive to setup and manage because of a large quantity of Nodes                              |
| Combined advantages of subnetworks' advantages; e.g. there can be high speed transfer between two Nodes with a Ring topology, and a fault-tolerant network with a Star topology | Diagnosing problems in the network can be difficult because of its complexity                             |
| A problem in one Node won't affect the entire network                                                                                                                           | The backbone which connects all subnetworks is critical and damage to it will collapse the entire network |

#### Mesh

> A mesh topology is a type of network topology where each Node can transmit and receive data packets with a peer to peer connection and does not require any intemediary devices to do so. If it is a wired mesh topology, every Node must have as many wires as the number of Nodes in the network minus 1. A common example of a mesh topology is a wireless home network.

| Advantages                                            | Disadvantages                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Excellent network performance                         | Extremely expensive and time consuming to setup and manage, a bit easier if wireless |
| Extremely secure and robust                           | Large scale cable management is extremely difficult                                  |
| A problem in one Node won't affect the entire network | Adding Nodes to the network is extremely difficult                                   |

#### Network Types

> Network types are different kinds of networks with different features, capacities and geographic scales. Networks include LAN, WAN, SAN, CAN, MAN, GAN, VPN and more.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Data_Networks_classification_by_spatial_scope.svg/300px-Data_Networks_classification_by_spatial_scope.svg.png)

#### LAN

> A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network type which connects devices within a a limited geographical area, such as a home or an office. LANs have high data transfer speed using Ethernet cables, with standard cables reaching 100 Gigabits per second (Gbit/s).

#### WAN

> A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network type which is used for telecommunication over a large geographic area from a city to intercontinental spans. Because of this distance, WAN tends to operate on Layers 1-3 of the OSI Model. A WAN can be used in a business so that it can function with clients and staff regardless of location.

#### SAN

> A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a network type which provides access to data storage devices. Typically, a SAN has its own network of data storage devices and can't be accessed through a LAN.

#### CAN

> A Campus Area Network (CAN) is a network type which is composed of LANs within a limited geographical area. These are used in areas larger for a LAN, but smaller for a MAN, such as a university to connect between buildings and campuses.

#### MAN

> A Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a network type which is a large network composed of smaller networks such as LANs, as large as cities.

#### Protocol

> A protocol is a set of rules for computers and devices to transmit data, receive data, connect, and communicate with each other.

#### TCP/IP

> IP is a protocol which is an address and its function is to transmit data packets from a source to an end device, and it is connectionless. TCP is a protocol used alongside IP for ordering packets and error checking. When data is transmitted over TCP from `A -> B`, A sends a `SYN` packet to B, then B sends back a `SYN` packet for synchronization alongside an `ACK`. The third step is for A to send back to B with an `ACK` packet to acknowledge a connection has started. This is known as a three way handshake, similar to requesting and granting authorization in an OAuth2 workflow. Now, packets can be sent through in order because of a connection.

#### SSL

> Secure Sockets Layer or SSL is a security protocol providing privacy, authentication and integrity to Internet connections and communications. A more modern version of SSL now is TLS (Transport Layer Security), and when SSL/TLS is integrated with HTTP, a web server's URL uses HTTPS instead of HTTP. SSL/TLS encrypts the data transmitted over the web, and like TCP, performs a handshake to ensure that two devices are meant to be. After the handshake, a key exchange is performed and then an encrypted HTTP Request/Response is made. An example of SSL/TLS application is for a web server that manages logins and bank details. Without TLS, it would be purely HTTP and the client would need to transfer plaintext over HTTP, which is incredibly vulnerable. With TLS, it is encrypted and meaningless to a potential attacker.

#### HTTP

> Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP is used to load pages from a web server with hyperlinks. HTTP is on the top layer of the OSI model; Layer 7 the Application Layer, and a typical workflow is a client sending a HTTP request to a server, then the server sending a response back, typically JSON data and a status code.

#### FTP

> File Transfer Protocol or FTP is a protocol used for transferring files between computers over a TCP/IP network. Users that have been granted access from the handshake are able to receive and transfer files through the FTP server. A secure version of FTP is called SFTP.
